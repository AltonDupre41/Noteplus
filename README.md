# Description
Noteplus is a simple note taking desktop application that allows for easy sorting of notes as well as application specific notes.
Notes are seperated into 'Note Sets' which can be opened through the program itself. Note sets can also be assigned to an application given its path, if NotePlus is running in the background opening the specified application will open the designated note set.
